# Programming Patterns for a Game Designer
Game Design with Programming Patterns is an interactive collection and short essay series examining how software design can aid a digital game designer.

Designing a digital game should be in concert with the limitations and constraints of the form. And a lot of game design emphasizes analog prototyping with dice, paper, and other tools. But creating a digital game requires manipulation of digital components. An analog-first approach means that digital creation is an act of translation: mostly implementing an existing paper design in a digital format. This doesn't allow for a designer's creativity to be emphasized in the process.

This project was born out of a need to understand how digital games are constructed. These programming patterns are common software strategies used all over digital interactive art. I have produced implementations of the seven most common in digital game design. These patterns are demonstrated in toy-like form that emphasizes their affordances to a designer. Each pattern is accompanied by an essay documenting the pattern, how it is implemented in the interactive project, and some remarks about the pattern's utility to a game designer.
