# Programming Patterns for a Game Designer
A repo to hold the code from the A Game Designer's Thoughts on Programming Patterns blog series.

As a game designer, I have always felt at odds with the programming implementation process. When making a game design, I will be able to craft a system in paper form and scale upward with relative ease. So when I translate a game to digital, it is exactly that: a translation. This doesn't give the digital implementation its due. Programming is more than just an implementation tool; it is a creative process unto itself. I think it's necessary to include the programming into the prototyping and design process as much as I would include the scissors or paper of my physical prototypes.

So here, I will attempt to relate programming concepts to analogous practices in Game Design. I will be going over the primary patterns in Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/. With each pattern, I am trying to see how a game designer should think about these patterns and consider their utility and influence on a game's design. This will be a series of implementations of patterns with notes about programming, and a series of blog posts about how they work.
